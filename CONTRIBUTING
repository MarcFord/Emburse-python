STYLE GUIDE
===========
    This project follows the PEP8, http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/, style guide for Python.

    *   For non-trivial changes, please update the CHANGELOG file. If your changes alter existing behavior, please
        document this.
    *   New features should be documented. Include examples and use cases where appropriate. If possible, include a
        sample that is displayed in the generated output.
    *   Add appropriate unit tests.

    Naming Conventions
    ==================
        Class names: CamelCase, with acronyms kept uppercase (HTTPWriter and not HttpWriter)
        Variable names: lowercase_with_underscores
        Method and function names: lowercase_with_underscores
        Constants: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
        precompiled regular expressions: name_re
        Protected members are prefixed with a single underscore.

        On classes with keywords, trailing underscores are appended. Clashes with builtins are allowed and must not be
        resolved by appending an underline to the variable name. If the function needs to access a shadowed builtin, rebind
        the builtin to a different name instead.

        Function and method arguments:
        class methods: cls as first parameter
        instance methods: self as first parameter
        lambdas for properties might have the first parameter replaced with x like in
        display_name = property(lambda x: x.real_name or x.username)

    Docstrings
    ==========
        All docstrings are to be formatted to work with Sphinx. Depending on the number of lines in the docstring, they
        are laid out differently. If itâ€™s just one line, the closing triple quote is on the same line as the opening,
        otherwise the opening quote and the triple quote that closes the string are on its own line.

    Deprecating a Feature
    =====================
        If a feature has been improved or modified in a backwards-incompatible way, the old feature or behavior will be
        deprecated.
